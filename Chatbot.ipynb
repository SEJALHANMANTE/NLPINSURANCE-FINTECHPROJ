       "🤖 Bot: In India, insurance coverage for individuals above 75 years of age is possible, but it depends on the type of policy and insurer. Here are the key details:\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. **Senior Citizen-Specific Policies**  \n",
       "   Many insurers offer **dedicated health insurance plans for seniors** (e.g., Star Health's Senior Citizen Red Carpet, National Insurance's Varistha Mediclaim). These typically:  \n",
       "   - Cover individuals up to **90 years** (renewable for life in some cases).  \n",
       "   - Require **medical check-ups** for enrollment.  \n",
       "   - Include features like **pre-existing disease coverage** (after a 2–4-year waiting period).  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 2. **IRDAI Guidelines**  \n",
       "   Insurers cannot deny coverage solely based on age (as per regulations). However, they may:  \n",
       "   - Charge **higher premiums** due to age-related risks.  \n",
       "   - Impose **co-payment clauses** (e.g., 20–30% of claims shared by the insured).  \n",
       "   - Exclude certain treatments or limit the **sum insured**.  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 3. **Critical Factors**  \n",
       "   - **Pre-existing conditions**: Declare them upfront; coverage may start after a waiting period.  \n",
       "   - **Renewability**: Ensure the policy is lifelong renewable.  \n",
       "   - **Group/Floter Plans**: Some family floaters allow senior members if the primary insured is younger.  \n",
       "\n",
       "### 4. **Suggestions**  \n",
       "   - Compare policies via platforms like **Policybazaar** or **Coverfox**.  \n",
       "   - Consult insurers directly (e.g., Star Health, HDFC Ergo) for tailored options.  \n",
