Think of it like adding more cookies to a jar, but only the new cookies have the same rules as before.\n2. **Waiting periods for pre-existing diseases**: If a specified disease or procedure is connected to a pre-existing condition, and the condition falls under the waiting period for pre-existing diseases (i.e., a certain amount of time must pass before coverage kicks in), then the longer waiting period will apply. Even if you didn't have the condition when you bought the policy, if it's related to a pre-existing condition, you'll still have to wait for the longer period before coverage starts.\n3. **Waiting periods for listed conditions**: Finally, if a condition is listed as one that's not covered (listed conditions), then the waiting period for that condition will still apply, even if you contracted it after buying the policy or if it was declared and accepted without a specific exclusion. Think of it like having a special \"no-trees-in-the-front-yard\" rule; even if you plant a new tree, you still have to wait for the waiting period to pass before the insurance starts covering it.\n\nIn summary, this clause ensures that when the sum insured is increased, the exclusions still apply, and when pre-existing diseases or listed conditions are involved, the waiting periods are enforced to maintain fairness and consistency in the insurance policy.",
