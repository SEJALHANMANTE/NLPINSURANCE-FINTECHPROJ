      "The clause describes three insurance-related terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Migration**: A facility allowing policyholders to transfer credits gained for pre-existing diseases and waiting periods to a new health insurance policy with the same insurer.\n",
      "2. **Newborn Baby**: A baby born during the policy period, aged between 1 and 90 days.\n",
      "3. **Network Provider**: Hospitals or healthcare providers enlisted by the insurer or TPA (Third-Party Administrator) to provide medical services to insured individuals on a cashless basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation in Easy-to-Understand Words:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Migration**: Imagine you have a health insurance policy with a particular company, and you want to switch to a different plan with the same company. If you've already served the waiting period for certain health conditions (like diabetes or hypertension), you wouldn't want to start from scratch with a new waiting period, right? The \"migration\" facility allows you to carry forward the credits you've earned towards those waiting periods to your new policy. This way, you can enjoy continuous coverage without having to restart the waiting period.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Newborn Baby**: This refers to a baby born during the time your insurance policy is active (the policy period). The baby is eligible for coverage under your policy as long as they are between 1 day and 90 days old.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Network Provider**: When you need medical treatment, you don't want to pay out of pocket, right? A \"network provider\" is a hospital or healthcare service provider that has a tie-up with your insurance company. This means that if you go to one of these network providers for treatment, your insurance company will pay the bill directly, so you don't have to pay upfront. It's like having a pre-arranged agreement for cashless medical care.\n"
