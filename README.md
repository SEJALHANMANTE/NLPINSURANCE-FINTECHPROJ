# ü§ñ InsureBot: AI-Powered Insurance Chatbot and Policy Recommender

## üåü Overview

The **InsureBot** project is an advanced AI system designed to revolutionize the insurance customer experience. It combines a natural language processing (NLP) powered **chatbot** for answering customer queries based on insurance documents with an intelligent **policy recommendation engine**.

This system aims to improve customer service efficiency, provide instant information retrieval from complex policy documents, and offer personalized product suggestions to users.

## üöÄ Key Features

  * **Intelligent Chatbot:** Provides accurate, instant answers to customer questions by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over internal insurance documentation.
  * **Document Retrieval System (DRS):** Efficiently searches and retrieves relevant clauses and information from large volumes of insurance policy documents.
  * **Policy Recommendation Engine:** Analyzes user profiles and past interactions to recommend the most suitable insurance products.
  * **NLP Workflow:** Utilizes a full-stack NLP pipeline for data preparation, modeling, and output generation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology and System Architecture

The project is structured around two main components: the Chatbot/DRS and the Policy Recommendation module. The overall architecture is driven by a robust NLP pipeline.

### **1. NLP Workflow**

The core functionality relies on a multi-stage Natural Language Processing (NLP) flow.

  * **Input Acquisition:** Data ingestion from various sources (e.g., policy documents, user queries).
  * **Preprocessing:** Cleaning, tokenization, and normalization of text data.
  * **Modeling:** Application of deep learning models for tasks like semantic search and classification.
  * **Output Generation:** Delivering the final response or recommendation to the user.

### **2. Insurance Chatbot Methodology (Question Answering & Retrieval)**

The chatbot functions by interpreting the user's query, retrieving information from a knowledge base of documents, and formulating an answer.

  * **Query Analysis:** Identifying the intent and key entities in the user's question.
  * **Document Retrieval:** The system uses a **Document Retrieval** method  to pinpoint the most relevant policy documents or text snippets.
  * **Response Generation:** Using the retrieved context, the chatbot generates a human-like, accurate response.

### **3. Policy Recommendation Methodology**

The recommendation system uses a separate pipeline to match users with policies.

  * **Data Collection & Processing:** Ingesting user data, policy features, and historical interaction data.
  * **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features for the recommendation model (e.g., user risk profile, policy compatibility).
  * **Recommendation Model:** Using a **Cosine similarity** to make suggestions and then give it to LLM for detailed outputs.

## üìö Data

The project utilizes the following data sources:

  * **Policy Documents:** A corpus of insurance policies in **PDF** used as the knowledge base for the DRS.
  * **Synthetic Insurance Policies data:** Containing policy details.
